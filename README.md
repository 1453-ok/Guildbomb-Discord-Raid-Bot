# Guildbomb - Raiding Bot
ðŸ’£ Guildbomb is a simple discord-bot, which shows you how easy it can be to raid a discord-server within one minute, so everybody will be banned, all emojis will be deleted, all invites will be deleted, every role and every channel too..

## What's the Guildbomb Bot?
The Guildbomb Bot is a raid bot with a simple configuration.

## Why did you code this?
It's one of my first projects tbh, I published the Guildbomb to show everyone how easy it can be to raid discord-servers
Discord raids aren't that rare, that's the reason why I also published an [Antiraid Bot which's called Crowby](https://crowby.me/)

## Should I raid others with the Guildbomb Bot?
**NO.** I really advise against it, raiding others is against the Discord TOS so please, **don't do it.**

## You want to test the Guildbomb Bot?
Alright, you can do that. But please use an alt-account AND [create a template](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041033511-Server-Templates#:~:text=Creating%20a%20Server%20Template,-Note%3A%20This%20feature&text=After%20you%20fill%20out%20the,to%20share%20your%20Server%20Template!), you can use templates from [this website](https://discord.style/) for example.
